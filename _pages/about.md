Hao Liu is currently a Research Scientist at Business Intelligence Lab, [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/). 
Before that, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk) (2017-2018).
Hao received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from (HKUST) in 2017, supervised by Prof. [Lionel M. Ni](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~ni/) and Prof. [Qiong Luo](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~luo/), and a M.Phil. degree in 2014, supervised by Prof. [Ke Yi](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yike/). He also received a Bachelor degree from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/) in 2012.
His general research interests are in data mining, machine learning, and big data management, with a special focus on mobile analytics and urban computing.
