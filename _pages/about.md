After spending several years in industrial research, Hao back to [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk), where he started his research career.
Hao was a Research Scientist at Business Intelligence Lab, [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/) and a Postdoctoral Fellow at the HKUST.
Hao received his Ph.D. degree and M.Phil. degree from HKUST in 2017 and 2014, respectively. He also received a Bachelor degree from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/) in 2012.
His general research interests are in data mining, machine learning, and big data management, with a special focus on mobile analytics and urban computing.

<span style="color:red"> **[Open Positions]** </span> Several Ph.D. student (2022 fall) and Postdoctoral Fellow positions available! 
I am also recruiting self-motivated long term (at least six months) visting students. Please feel free to send your resume to liuh\[AT\]ust\[DOT\]hk. Experiences of top-tier academic publications, data mining challenge awards, and ICPC awards are strong plus.
